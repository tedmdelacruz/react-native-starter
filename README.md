# React Native Starter Kit

This is my personal starter kit for developing Android apps
using React Native on Redux

# TODO
- [ ] Start from `create-react-native-app`
- [ ] Integrate NativeBase
- [ ] Setup routes and pages
- [ ] Setup MobX
- [ ] Setup mock server
- [ ] Setup asynchronous server calls

# Setup

```
adb devices
emulator -avd <DeviceName> 
yarn
npm install -g react-native-cli
react-native run-android
